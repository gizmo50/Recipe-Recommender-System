# Recipe-Recommender-System
This project is a fusion of machine learning and culinary skills to generate a recommender system that suggests recipes a user can make from the ingredients available with him.
The team used a mixed database with maximum Indian dishes and few spices of international cuisine and fusion recipes. This database was used into a python program that used machine learning concepts like Cosine Similarity to match input ingredients with ingredients in the database and then gives the a choice of 3 relevant recipes to the user.
The result is displayed on the website locally hosted. The website is also used to take input from the user. It will serve as the intermediate between the user and the machine learning model
